## SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION
Welcome to the Aether-7 Smart Home Hub. This device is designed to centralize your home automation experience.
The Aether-7 acts as a bridge between your Wi-Fi network and Zigbee, Z-Wave, and Matter devices.
Unlike previous generations, the Aether-7 processes all voice commands locally on the device using the Neural-X chip.
This ensures that your voice data never leaves your home, providing a significant privacy upgrade over cloud-based assistants.
The device features a 7-inch OLED touch display with a resolution of 1920x1080.
It includes dual front-facing speakers and a far-field microphone array capable of detecting voice commands from up to 30 feet away.
The chassis is made from recycled aluminum and includes a non-slip rubber base.
Power is supplied via a USB-C PD adapter (included in the box).

## SECTION 2: IMPORTANT SAFETY WARNINGS
1. Do not submerge the Aether-7 in water. It is IP54 rated (splash resistant) but not waterproof.
2. Do not block the ventilation grills on the rear of the unit. Overheating may cause the device to shut down.
3. Use only the provided USB-C power adapter. Third-party adapters with less than 45W output will result in "Low Power" warnings.
4. Keep the device away from direct heat sources like radiators or stove tops.
5. The device contains a small lithium-ion backup battery. Do not puncture the device.
6. If the device emits smoke or a strange odor, disconnect power immediately and contact support.
7. Do not attempt to open the casing. There are no user-serviceable parts inside.
8. Listening to audio at maximum volume for extended periods may damage the speakers.
9. Ensure the power cord is not a tripping hazard.
10. Keep small accessories away from children under 3 years old.

## SECTION 3: INITIAL SETUP GUIDE
Step 1: Unbox the device and place it on a flat, stable surface.
Step 2: Plug the USB-C cable into the port labeled "POWER" on the back.
Step 3: Connect the adapter to a wall outlet. The Aether logo will appear on the screen.
Step 4: Wait for the boot sequence (approximately 45 seconds).
Step 5: When the "Welcome" screen appears, tap "Get Started".
Step 6: Select your language from the list.
Step 7: The device will scan for available Wi-Fi networks. Select your network.
Step 8: Enter your Wi-Fi password using the on-screen keyboard.
Step 9: The device will check for firmware updates. This may take up to 10 minutes.
Step 10: Once updated, you will be asked to create or log in to your Aether account.
Step 11: You can link your account using the Aether Mobile App (available on iOS and Android).
Step 12: Scan the QR code displayed on the screen with the mobile app.
Step 13: Assign the device to a room (e.g., "Living Room", "Kitchen").
Step 14: The setup is complete. You can now say "Hey Aether" to test the voice assistant.

## SECTION 4: CONNECTING PERIPHERALS
The Aether-7 supports up to 128 connected devices.
To add a new device, go to Settings -> Devices -> Add New.
Select the device type (Light, Lock, Sensor, Camera, Thermostat).
Put the peripheral device into pairing mode (consult the peripheral's manual).
The Aether-7 will auto-detect the device within 60 seconds.
If the device is a Zigbee bulb, ensure it is within 20 feet of the hub during pairing.
If the device is a Z-Wave lock, you may need to enter the DSK code found on the lock's packaging.
For Matter devices, scan the Matter QR code using the Aether-7's built-in camera (located on the top bezel).
You can rename devices after pairing (e.g., change "Bulb-X99" to "Reading Lamp").
Groups can be created to control multiple devices at once.
Example: Create a group called "Movie Mode" that dims lights and closes blinds.
